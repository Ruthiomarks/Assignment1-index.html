<p>I am originally from Liverpool in the UK. I decided to come to Australia for a working holiday in June 2009. After spending a few months in this county I decided that I could see myself living here for the foreseeable future, I decided to go fruit picking to give me an extra visa which then would give me further time to find a suitable job who would be willing to sponsor me to stay. <p>
<p>My background is quite varied. When I first finished school, I went on to study a diploma of Accounting back in Liverpool. I then moved into retail and become a franchise owner of a popular optometrist located in North Sydney. After 8/9 years I decided to sell my shares in the franchise and not being sure of what I wanted to do next I took a job in medical recruitment whilst I decided on a career path. <p>

<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I think how far technology has come is fascinating. I read an article not so long ago from the New York times the article was originally written when the first television was being introduced. The article was basically slating the need for such a device and the people of New York will never use one as they are way too busy to do so. How wrong the article was. Not only has Television become a part of our daily lives, it is also outstanding how far even television viewing has come. 3D TV, virtual television, interactive and the list goes on. <p>
<p>My personal interest began when as previously mentioned I had decided to sell my shares in the franchise I owned. I immediately began looking for a new career. I wanted something exciting and ever evolving. Something where I would continually need to learn and adapt, whilst of course paying well. As I was researching various careers which would suite my criteria, the COVID 19 pandemic hit. I was as virtually every industry suffered. I noticed that the majority of anything to do technology seemed to boom. I also looked back at the rate of employment and job growth within this sector and was amazed at the phenomenal rate this had grown and was continuing to do so. <p>
<p>The only IT experience I have is very basic Microsoft office and excel. I also have experience with various POS systems within a retail environment. I will consider myself an absolute rookie when it comes to IT as my previous roles have never required me to do anything very technical apart from sending lots of emails, creating the odd letter and spreadsheet here and there. Therefore, I knew I needed training before I even attempted to find a job within the industry. <p>
<p>Due to working full time I needed a course which I would be able to do on evening and weekends. I began searching various university not only in Australia but across the world. I spoke to various student advisors and found RMIT to be the most friendly and helpful. I felt confident this University would be the best choice for me and enrolled the next day. <p>

<h2 style="color:Tomato;">Ideal Job</h2>
<p>After deciding upon a career in IT I also investigated what jobs there are. I immediately was interested in becoming an Ethical Hacker. An ethical Hackers job is to ensure a business or organisations computer systems are safe. As in the title of the job they are basically hired to hack into the company or organisations network as to identify where any weak areas or issues may lie. This role is known as penetration tester within Australia. <p>
<p>My father owns his own accountancy business. One day he was hacked, and the hacker took months and months’ worth of data he had been working on for various clients and demanded money in exchange. My father decided not to give in to these demands and as a result lost a lot of work. <p>
<p>When I read about the Ethical Hacker role, I immediately remembered what had happened and I would love the opportunity to help business/ organisations to be safe from these cyber criminals. <p>
<p>Average Pay: $100,000- $120,000<p>
<p>In order to become a Ethical Hacker you firstly would need a bachelors degree in IT, cybersecurity or engineering etc. Due to the level of responsibility of this role you would need to gain some relevant experience either in entry level IT roles or network admin etc. After a period of sometime most organisations would offer various programs where you would be able to gain certifications for ethical hacking fields. Once these steps have been completed you would then be able to be considered for a role. Normally companies looking for ethical hackers require 4+ years of experience once again due to the responsibility of the role. <p>

<p>As previously mentioned, my highest qualification is a Diploma in accountancy, nor do I possess any experience in computing apart from school level. This would not meet the criteria for this role. My Plan is to obtain a bachelor’s degree in IT once I have completed this course I plan on obtaining an entry level role which would provide a career path to further my knowledge and enable me to gain whether it be voluntary or paid in programs that lead to certifications in ethical hacking, security analysis, pen testing  and related fields. <p>

<p>The Big Five Personality Test <p>
<p>https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/26462251<p>
<p>Results:<p>
<p>-	Openness 52%<p>
<p>-	Conscientiousness 48%<p>
<p>-	Extraversion 77%<p>
<p>-	Agreeableness 79%<p>
<p>-	Neuroticism 40% <p>
<p>I think doing various personality tests can help you better understand yourself more. Also providing an explanation why doing things in certain ways in the past has not worked. You learn about your strengths and weaknesses. You can use this information to help you learn better. For example one of my learning results said I am a tactile learner, now I know this I know not to rely on sitting and just listening to a lecture I actually have to get my hands on things and give things ago. Without doing the learning style test I would not have known. <p>
<p>I think knowing these results will help in a team environment by helping you better understand other people. We all have different situations that we are going to perform best in and knowing this will help us take a back seat when necessary and when to excel. <p>
<p>This also is helpful when forming a team as in an ideal world you want the best of everything choosing people with opposing strengths and weaknesses for example, so the team is well rounded. This can also help ensure you do not have too many strong personalities wanting to take the lead and also too many people sitting back waiting for someone to make a decision. <p>
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Project Idea</h1>
<p>I currently work in recruitment in the medical sector. My role is placing locum doctors into rural Hospitals across Australia. My project idea would be to do this via an app which would connect doctors direct to the hospitals cutting out the middleman. Hospitals within Australia spend millions in fees to various recruitment agencies in order for a doctor to be placed in their hospital. My idea is they would pay a subscription for the app and then could place as many doctors as they chose. <p>
<p>I originally got into recruitment within the healthcare industry as I was told I would be helping rural hospitals and their communities. I felt that in fact we are ripping hospitals off as we simply advertise the various vacancies to our database and doctor gets in touch and says they are free. We then do a basic reference and along with an up to date CV we then present them to the Hospital with there availability. Unlike other areas of recruitment where as the recruiter you would interview the candidate yourself for suitability only present candidates which you would think would fit in to the particular business you where recruiting for, we simply present the doctor with just a cv and two references there is no skill involved. And yet we charge on average $340 per day a doctor works. For example, of I book a doctor for 5 weeks the Hospital is paying the agency on average $8500 just in fees alone. I think my app would reduce the amount of fees the Hospitals pay by an astronomical amount. <p>
<p>When doctors graduate, they always sign up to various recruitment agencies and would get various job alerts from all the different agencies. Each agency may have just one Hospital which the other agency does not. Hence the reason why doctors sign up to all the different agencies. This is annoying for doctors for several reasons. Each agency they sign up to they must provide details of two referees for them to contact. Also, they need to be credentialled at each agency which requirements mountains of paperwork. This frustrates the doctors as they are extremely busy and do not want to disturb their colleagues.  Most agencies work with the same Hospitals which then also means the doctors are receiving multiple alerts from various agencies for the same jobs. <p>
<p>My app would mean doctors have one place where they could see all the locum vacancies. And hospitals would be able to book doctors direct through the app. <p>
<p>The doctor would just have to upload references and credentialling documents once unless they expired. The app would have alerts not only for jobs but when documents expire. Another benefit would be is doctors could filter the alerts they receive for example if they only want to work with Queensland Hospitals. Currently doctors receive alerts state-wide. <p>
<p>If they are no longer available to locum, they can mark themselves as inactive and not appear in the system. Doctors would be able to input their availability and use a filter based on what vacancies match there availability rather than receiving an alert whether you are available or not. Doctors can choose to enter there availability ahead of time; therefore, hospitals can get a better understanding ahead of time which helps out with rostering of their full time staff. <p>
<p>Hospitals would be able to see which doctors have marked themselves as available and contact them directly rather than being sent hundreds of CVs they can cherry pick the doctors they would prefer. They can remove the vacancy from the app at any time. At the moment a Hospital will send an email to all the different agencies with the original vacancy but then once the vacancy is filled agencies can still be calling and chasing the hospital and continuing to send CVS which clogs up emails and wastes a lot of time. Hospitals would be able to access the doctors credentialing instead of waiting for this from the recruitment consultant which sometimes send incorrect of forgets to send at all. <p>
<p>The app would feature other information for example on call requirements, size of Hospital, what type of support would they have, type of lists etc. Currently the doctor asks the recruitment agent who then, if they do not have answers asks the Hospital which sometimes can take a few days. With my app I intend to create any information not on the app, the doctor can send a request for further information and receive a response directly with the Hospital. Cutting out the middleman would save time.<p>
<p>Wireframing is a digital sketch and provides outlines for layouts and other functions so you can get and idea how of various elements of the app will work. There are many wireframing applications to choose from such as www.auxure.com, www.affinity.serif.com/en-gb, www.wireflow.co, there are many app development platforms you can choose from Swing2App, AppyPie, AppSheet, Bizness Apps.  <p>
<p>In order to develop apps friendly not only for desktop but IOS and android I would need access to a MAC running the latest version of OS X. To create apps for Android I can use Java by downloading the free software. <p>
<p>The best apps created are normally by a whole team due to the various elements. Graphic designers would have excellent input mobile developer, backend developer business analysis, accounting. <p>
<p>Creating the app is one thing I would also need to enlist a marketing company. Due to working in the industry I have connections to many doctors who I could advertise this app to. Whilst the app is free for doctors to sign up to, Hospitals must pay. I should look at maybe enlisting a professional salesman/woman to pitch to the decision makers at each of the Hospitals and to encourage doctors to sign up. <p>
<p>If my project is successful, this would mean Hospitals would no longer require the use of a recruitment agency and can contact doctors direct themselves via the app. This would mean Hospitals would be saving millions every year on agency fees but still benefit from being provided doctors who are able to locum. This would prevent the same doctor being presented to the Hospital by multiple agencies. Hospital medical admin would have more time to focus on more important tasks in stead of speaking to multiple agencies about the same vacancy/problem. <p>
